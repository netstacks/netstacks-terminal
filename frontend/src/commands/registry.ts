/**
 * CommandRegistry — central, observable store of every registered
 * Command. Designed to live for the entire app lifetime.
 *
 * Architecture
 * ------------
 * Why Zustand instead of a plain Map + EventEmitter:
 *   - React surfaces (menu, palette, context menus) need to re-render
 *     when commands register/unregister; Zustand gives us that for
 *     free with useStore selectors.
 *   - Non-React callers (the Tauri menu-event listener, future RPC)
 *     can read via getState() without becoming a hook.
 *   - subscribeWithSelector lets the native-menu enabled-state bridge
 *     watch the ActiveContext slice only, so re-evaluating `when`
 *     predicates doesn't trigger React re-renders for unaffected
 *     surfaces.
 *
 * Stability contract
 * ------------------
 *   - register() with a duplicate id is a programming error in dev
 *     (logs a warning) and a silent override in prod — the new entry
 *     wins. This favours not crashing the app over strict purity.
 *   - dispatch() of an unknown id is a no-op + warn. Useful when a
 *     surface was built against an older registry snapshot.
 *   - `when` is evaluated lazily on dispatch + on every menu rebuild.
 *     A registered command with a failing `when` predicate at dispatch
 *     time is silently no-op'd; the surface that requested it should
 *     have disabled itself first.
 *
 * Lifecycle
 * ---------
 * Surfaces register on mount via useCommand() and unregister on
 * unmount. The registry never garbage-collects on its own.
