//! Host-key approval service (AUDIT FIX REMOTE-001).
//!
//! Replaces silent TOFU. When `verify_or_store` sees an unknown host, it
//! creates a pending approval, surfaces the SHA-256 fingerprint to the
//! frontend, and waits up to 2 minutes for the user to click Accept or
//! Reject in a modal. No new keys are written to known_hosts without
//! explicit user consent.
//!
//! ## Mechanics
//!
//! - Each pending request is tracked by a UUID. The russh handshake
//!   thread blocks on a `tokio::sync::oneshot` channel waiting for the
//!   user to resolve the prompt.
//! - The frontend polls `GET /api/host-keys/prompts` every ~750 ms while
//!   it has any in-flight connection. When a matching prompt appears, it
//!   shows the modal.
//! - User accepts → `POST /api/host-keys/prompts/:id/approve` resolves the
//!   oneshot with `true` → handshake continues and the key is stored.
//! - User rejects → `POST /api/host-keys/prompts/:id/reject` resolves with
//!   `false` → handshake aborts with `HostKeyError::UserRejected`.
//! - If no resolution arrives within `PROMPT_TIMEOUT`, the handshake
//!   aborts with `HostKeyError::PromptTimeout`.
