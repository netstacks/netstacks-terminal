# Testing Gaps

Endpoints / features that the standalone-agent test suite cannot exercise because
they are controller-only or have been removed in the standalone split. Tests that
asserted these endpoints existed have been deleted from the phase test files;
this doc preserves the intent so the gap can be re-covered if the controller is
re-added or a standalone replacement ships.

## Phase 14 — Devices

### `device_import_csv` (was: `POST /devices/import/csv`)

- **Removed from**: `tests/api/tests/phase14_devices.rs`
- **Reason**: No `/devices/*` top-level routes exist on the standalone agent.
  Bulk device import (CSV / NetBox sync etc.) is part of the controller's
  inventory-management surface.
- **Re-cover when**: A standalone bulk-import endpoint is added (e.g. a
  per-agent local-inventory CSV importer).

### `credential_folders_list` (was: `GET /admin/credentials/folders`)
### `credential_folder_access` (was: `GET /admin/credentials/folders/:id/access`)
### `credential_personal_vaults` (was: `GET /admin/credentials/personal-vaults`)

- **Removed from**: `tests/api/tests/phase14_devices.rs`
- **Reason**: `/admin/credentials/*` is controller-only. The standalone agent
  exposes `/profiles/*` (per-session credential profiles) and `/vault/*`
  (single local vault) instead — there are no shared folders, no folder ACLs,
  and no per-user personal vaults.
- **Re-cover when**: Multi-user credential folder management ships in the
  standalone agent (currently not on the roadmap).

### `agent_enable_disable` (was: `GET /agents`, `POST /agents/:id/{enable,disable}`)

- **Removed from**: `tests/api/tests/phase14_devices.rs`
- **Reason**: `/agents` was the controller's fleet-management endpoint (list
  registered agent processes and toggle them). The standalone agent has no
  notion of remote agents — it *is* the agent. The closest sibling endpoint,
  `/agent-definitions`, is for AI agent definitions and has no enable/disable.
- **Re-cover when**: A standalone deployment grows multi-agent topology
  awareness (e.g. peer agents in a mesh).
